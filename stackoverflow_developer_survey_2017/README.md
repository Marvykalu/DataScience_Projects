# Becoming a Software Developer: Novice to Pro

## Introduction

As part of tech jobs, there are many views when it comes to becoming a software developer. Questions such as: Do I need a degree in computer science or software engineering? Do I need a degree higher than Bachelor's to have a good job satisfaction as a software developer? What other methods asides formal education can I take in order to become a software developer? continue to be at the heart of many novice.

The good news is that we have data to help us have an insight as to how the software devoloping world really is and what it takes to break into the world. To this end, this project uses data from Stackoverflow's 2017 annual Developer survey.
