    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning on the internet. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built-in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are spammy messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize', or similar words in them, as these texts are designed to catch your eye and tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we know what we are trying to predict. We will be feeding a labeled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.\n",

    "### Step 2.1: Bag of words ###\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have here in our data set is a large collection of text data (5,572 rows of data). Most ML algorithms rely on numerical data to be fed into them as input, and email/sms messages are usually text heavy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'd like to introduce the Bag of Words(BoW) concept which is a term used to specify the problems that have a 'bag of words' or a collection of text data that needs to be worked with. The basic idea of BoW is to take a piece of text and count the frequency of the words in that text. It is important to note that the BoW concept treats each word individually and the order in which the words occur does not matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a process which we will go through now, we can covert a collection of documents to a matrix, with each document being a row and each word(token) being the column, and the corresponding (row,column) values being the frequency of occurrance of each word or token in that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say we have 4 documents as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`['Hello, how are you!',\n",
    "'Win money, win from home.',\n",
    "'Call me now',\n",
    "'Hello, Call you tomorrow?']`\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective here is to convert this set of text to a **frequency distribution matrix**, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"countvectorizer.png\" height=\"542\" width=\"542\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here as we can see, the documents are numbered in the rows, and each word is a column name, with the corresponding value being the frequency of that word in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets break this down and see how we can do this conversion using a small set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this, we will be using sklearns \n",
    "[count vectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) method which does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It tokenizes the string(separates the string into individual words) and gives an integer ID to each token.\n",
    "* It counts the occurrance of each of those tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please Note:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* The CountVectorizer method automatically converts all tokenized words to their lower case form so that it does not treat words like 'He' and 'he' differently. It does this using the `lowercase` parameter which is by default set to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It also ignores all punctuation so that words followed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello!') are not treated differently than the same words not prefixed or suffixed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello'). It does this using the `token_pattern` parameter which has a default regular expression which selects tokens of 2 or more alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The third parameter to take note of is the `stop_words` parameter. Stop words refer to the most commonly used words in a language. They include words like 'am', 'an', 'and', 'the' etc. By setting this parameter value to `english`, CountVectorizer will automatically ignore all words(from our input text) that are found in the built in list of english stop words in scikit-learn. This is extremely helpful as stop words can skew our calculations when we are trying to find certain key words that are indicative of spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive into the application of each of these into our model in a later step, but for now it is important to be aware of such preprocessing techniques available to us when dealing with textual data."
